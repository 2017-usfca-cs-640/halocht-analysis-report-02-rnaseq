Introduction
============

Background
----------

Lung cancer has been identified worldwide as the most prevalent type of cancer with the highest mortality rates in developed countries (Sakurai *et al.*, 2010; Li *et al.*, 2015; Seo *et al.*, 2012). Tobacco cigarette smoking has been identified as the main contributer, along with a host of other genetic and environmental factors, to cause Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Genetic research in this field has mainly focused on finding the gene-expression differences between non-smokers and smokers with NSCLC and even between smokers who have and have not contracted any form of NSCLC (Cheng *et al.*, 2012; Li *et al.*, 2015; Seo *et al.*, 2012). These studies have found significant gene expression profile differences between smokers and nonsmokers with NSCLC; however, these studies have not addressed gender-based expression differences.

Although there has been an over 500% increase in lung cancer rates among women since the 1980's, it is becoming increasingly evident that women contain gender-based genetic differences that predicate a favorable prognosis and higher survival rate than men when normalizing for other factors (Is there a gender difference in non-small cell lung cancer survival?, 2004; Sakurai *et al.*, 2010). These gender-based differences have only been observed on clinicopathological basis with not much emphasis on the genetic data that may be available for such an analysis. Although common grounds have not been genetically established for a gender-based analysis of NSCLC, the disease has been able to be characterized genetically, by mutational analysis.

Given how 60 of the known carcinogens in tobacco smoke can actively mutate cells to become cancerous, there have been several somatic point mutations as well as aberrant fusion gene products identified specifically in NSCLC \[(Al-Saad *et al.*, 2017; Cheng *et al.*, 2012; Seo *et al.*, 2012; Yokota, 2000). These genes can serve as a basis for a potential gender-based NSCLC analysis because they are not gender-discriminate, and because the resulting biology from their mutations is relatively well understood.

Objective
---------

In this study, to emphasize that there are key distinctions between male and female gene expression profiles, genes that have been identified through somatic point mutations and contributing to malignency in NSCLC will be analyzed per the Li et al dataset and metadata (Al-Saad *et al.*, 2017; Li *et al.*, 2015). Specifically, the genes that will be analyzed are Epithelial growth factor receptor (EFGR), Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS), mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) as well as insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGFR1), all of which are potential therapeutic targets against advancing malignancy. It is also important to note that EFGR1, IGFR1 and MET (more commonly known as c-Met or HGFR) not only play critical roles in activating pathways such as RAS-MAPK pathway, but are also characterized as important in patient-developed treatment resistance (Al-Saad *et al.*, 2017). Furthermore, Al-Saad et al. describes that high expression of MET and EFGR1 (either through high gene copy or abberant transcription amplification) are indicative biomarkers of a negative prognosis in NSCLC (Al-Saad *et al.*, 2017). The expression of these genes will be divided by gender, age at diagnosis, and cancer stage to elucidate how women have gene expression differences that contribute to a better prognosis in NSCLC.

Methods
=======

Sample origin and sequencing
----------------------------

The dataset generated by Seo et al. for their journal article, The transcriptional landscape and mutational profile of lung adenocarcinoma, was obtained by collecting 200 specimens from 87 patients inflicted with lung adenocarcinoma who had undergone major lung resection surgeries at Saint Mary's Hospital in Seoul, South Korea. The patients provided their smoking history which included smokers (47), non-smokers (36), and some who did not not disclose their smoking history (4). All of the samples originated from people of Korean ethnicity, and out of the 200 specimen, 87 were identified as cancerous stemming from driver mutations while 77 samples were identified to be normal tissue as a basis for comparison of gene expression profiles against the cancerous samples. Together, these 164 were RNA-sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer yielding ~ 14 billion paired-end, 101-bp long reads (Seo *et al.*, 2012). Additionally, genomic DNA was extracted from normal lung tissue for exome sequencing. Together, the RNA and exome sequencing reads were aligned to the NCBI human reference genome (build 37.1) using GSNAP with a 5% allowance for mismatches. Image analysis and basecalling was performed using the Illumina pipeline on the default settings (v1.8).

Li et al. obtained 68 lung adenocarcinoma patient transcriptome sequencing data from the aforementioned Seo et al. study database. Each patient had their tumor and normal tissue sequenced comparitively, and the total amount and length of paired-end sequences mimicked the Seo et al. study because it was the same data. However, they normalized the data to be an equal amount of non-smokers (34) vs smokers (34) by exluding the data of patients over the age of 75 to ensure equal comparing grounds (Li *et al.*, 2015).

Computational
-------------

These are the methods that were used to process the sequencing data. Should probably be at least a half of a page. At a very minimum should include citations for biomartr, trimmomatic, and sailfish. Note that these three methods references don't count towards the five references you need to cite in the introduction.

Results
=======

Data was subsetted from Li et al. to create all the figures in the Results section. Importantly to note is that each gene that was analyzed (EGFR, KRAS, MET and IGF1R) has exactly the same number of samples (76) that were divided into 31 females and 45 males across all genes. This indicates that the results are comparable because essentially the same sub-sample set was used for each figure created. The data that was subsetted for the genes of interest however, failed to include any females in stage 2B, so there is no representation of females for that cancer stage for any gene of interest.

``` r
# Seo et al. discusses that 79% of their patients' NSCLC is driven by point mutations in EFGR.
EGFR <- final_table %>%
  filter(genename == "EGFR") %>%
  group_by(gender, age_at_diagnosis, cancer_stage) %>%
  summarize(mean_count = mean(counts_lengthscaledtpm)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_count))

EGFR %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cancer_stage,
             y = mean_count,
             fill = gender)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge", aes(color = age_at_diagnosis))
```

![](Analysis_Report_02_RNASeq_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/EFGR%20Expression%20at%20Different%20Canceer%20Stages-1.png) **Figure 2 Description**: Figure 2 shows EFGR expression according to gender through different cancer stages. EFGR expression is overall higher in males of any age at any cancer stage. The borders dividing the columns horizontally represent each gender at a specific cancer stage by age range, so it is evident that EFGR expression does not follow an age-trend in males as the high expression in stage 3A shows most of the males to be in their 80s while the high expression in stage 3B indicates that the population of males with high EFGR expression is closer to their 40s. Female expression of EFGR across all cancer stages is mostly inclusive to older women in their 70s and 80s.

``` r
KRAS <- final_table %>%
  filter(genename == "KRAS") %>%
  group_by(gender, age_at_diagnosis, cancer_stage) %>%
  summarize(mean_count = mean(counts_lengthscaledtpm)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_count))

KRAS %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cancer_stage,
             y = mean_count,
             fill = gender)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge", aes(color = age_at_diagnosis))
```

![](Analysis_Report_02_RNASeq_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/KRAS%20Expression%20at%20Different%20Canceer%20Stages-1.png) **Figure 3 Description**: Figure 3 shows KRAS expression according to gender through different cancer stages. KRAS expression across cancer stages is much higher than EFGR for both sexes. In general, both sexes have a much higher expression of KRAS in stages 1A-2B than they do in stages 3A-4 (not including NA cancer stage). There is also more vairance in the age ranges as it appears that all the age ranges experience KRAS expression in stages 1A and 1B. Females; however, show less expression of KRAS overall.

``` r
MET <- final_table %>%
  filter(genename == "MET") %>%
group_by(gender, age_at_diagnosis, cancer_stage) %>%
  summarize(mean_count = 
              mean(counts_lengthscaledtpm)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_count)) 

MET %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cancer_stage,
             y = mean_count,
             fill = gender)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge",
             aes(color = age_at_diagnosis)) 
```

![](Analysis_Report_02_RNASeq_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/MET%20Expression%20at%20Different%20Canceer%20Stages-1.png) **Figure 4 Description**: MET expression is shown in figure 4, and it can be seen that stage 1A for males and stage 1B for females resembles the KRAS expression in Figure 3 in terms of overall reads and age division reprentation. Overall, MET expression is higher in males in the later stages of cancer (except for 1A), but there is no trend in age factors. Conversely, MET expression is lower in females in later stages of cancer, but there is no age trend either. Female expression of MET is significantly lower overall whenc compared to male expression of MET across all cancer stages.

``` r
IGF1R <- final_table %>%
  filter(genename == "IGF1R") %>%
  group_by(gender, 
           age_at_diagnosis, 
           cancer_stage) %>%
  summarize(mean_count = 
              mean(counts_lengthscaledtpm)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_count))

IGF1R %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cancer_stage,
             y = mean_count,
             fill = gender)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge", aes(color = age_at_diagnosis))
```

![](Analysis_Report_02_RNASeq_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/IGF1R%20Expression%20at%20Different%20Canceer%20Stages-1.png) **Figure 5 Description**: Expression of IGF1R gives a much more detailed look at expression in females vs males than the rest of the genes because expression is much higher overall. Importantly, we see that male expression is much higher overall than any particular female expression at a specific stage. For males, the columns are more segmented across the stages which indicates that all age ranges are represented in male IGF1R expression. In comparison, females are predominantly more dominated by older age ranges.

Discussion
==========

Limitations: We have the patient data, but do not know if they have had any kind of previous operation to extract or get rid of the cancer in the metadata or what kind of treatment (if any) they have undergone. --&gt; nevermind, all of these samples were taken from lobectomies which means the cancers were removed already.

so from the metadata we actually do not have information about rate or amount of smoking, so it is hard to judge that. Add around 1-2 pages interpreting your results and considering future directions one might take in analyzing these data.
